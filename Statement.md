1. Problem Statement

Managing student information such as personal details, subject-wise marks, grades, and overall performance becomes difficult when handled manually or through unorganized files. Teachers and administrators often face challenges like data duplication, difficulty in searching records, lack of automated grading, and inefficiency in maintaining updated student reports.
A digital student management system is needed to store, update, search, and analyze student data in an easy and error-free way.
